## Description

During manufacturing, detail drawings can be lost or located in another department - searching for them leads to downtime for workers and failure to fulfill orders on time. An assembled detail can include up to 100 subdetails, which can have their own components, so it can be difficult to monitor the stage of execution and the drawing of each one.

This application allows you to structure information about parts, load their drawings, create notes and control the technological process. Created on Flutter.
